I am writing code for a tool to capture my scattered thoughts, store them and structure them using LLMs.
Attached is the design diagram. Write code for it in python.
Instructions:
1. Use poetry, create a new project and add dependencies
2. Use gemini for the LLM calls
3. Add typing using pydantic
4. Optimize the client side frontend for mobile phones
5. JSON to HTML output should be a static page not necessarily optimized for frotend
