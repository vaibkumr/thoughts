You are given a list of natural language strings, each representing a personal thought, reflection, or internal statement. Your task is to structure this input into two components:

# Classification Component
For each string, classify its psychological and cognitive attributes using the following schema:

"classification": {
  "<input string>": {
    "thought_content": "<one of: self-related, others-related, world-related, future-oriented, past-oriented, obsessive, delusional>",
    "sentiment": "<one of: negative, positive, neutral, ambivalent>",
    "metacognition": "<one of: self-judging, thought-as-fact, reflective, suppressed, none>",
    "category": "<reusable high-level tag, e.g., 'politics', 'technology', 'travel', 'relationships', 'finance'>"
  }
}
Generate reusable categories that thematically group similar thoughts (e.g., "politics", "finance", etc) and assign one to each string under "category".

# Knowledge Graph Component
Build a graph to represent semantic and psychological relationships between the thoughts.

Use this structure:

"graph": {
  "nodes": [
    "<string1>",
    "<string2>",
    ...
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "<string1>",
      "to": "<string2>",
      "relation": "a generated relation lable string"
    }
  ]
}
Generate and use a closed-set of edge relationships. The nodes of the graph MUST be full individual strings, not subtrings.


# Output Format
Your full output should be a single JSON object with two top-level keys: "classification" and "graph"
