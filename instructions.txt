You are given a list of natural language strings, each representing a personal thought, reflection, facts, or internal statement. Your task is to structure this input into one component:

# Classification Component
For each string, classify its psychological and cognitive attributes using the following schema:

"classification": {
  "<input string>": {
    "thought_content": "<one of: self-related, others-related, world-related, future-oriented, past-oriented, obsessive, delusional>",
    "thought_valence": "<one of: negative, positive, neutral, ambivalent>",
    "metacognition": "<one of: self-judging, thought-as-fact, reflective, suppressed, none>",
    "category": "<reusable high-level tag, e.g., 'politics', 'technology', 'travel', 'relationships', 'finance'>"
  }
}
Generate reusable categories that thematically group similar thoughts (e.g., "politics", "finance", etc) and assign one to each string under "category".

# Output Format
Your full output should be a single JSON object with one top-level key: "classification"
